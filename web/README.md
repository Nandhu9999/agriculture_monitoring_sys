# REACT FIREBASE SETUP PROJECT

**Personal Note**: This is a boilerplate project which has necessary code such as firebase auth and basic ui features. It consists of frontend mainly. I SHOULD also be able to migrate most of the code to React Native Expo!

- Typescript
- Tailwind
- React Router
- TanStack Query
- State Management (zustand, useContext)
- Firebase as Auth
- NodeJS as backend
- Optional MongoDB as Database

## Project Requirements
